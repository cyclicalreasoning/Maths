## Nonstandard Analysis and Applications in Ramsey Theory
**Abstract:** This is an expository paper in which we define nonstandard models, the transfer principle, and the basic properties of filters to construct the hyperreals, hyperintegers, and hypernaturals and prove the relevant properties of said systems. Subsequently, we reformulate and prove the Infinite Ramsey's Theorem, Hindman's Theorem, and Rado's Theorem using nonstandard methods.
