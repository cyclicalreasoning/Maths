## Nonstandard Analysis and Applications in Ramsey Theory
**Abstract:** This is an expository paper in which we define nonstandard models, the transfer principle, and the basic properties of filters to construct the hyperreals, hyperintegers, and hypernaturals and prove the relevant properties of said systems. Subsequently, we reformulate and prove the Infinite Ramsey's Theorem, Hindman's Theorem, and Rado's Theorem using nonstandard methods. 

Nonstandard methods evolved from an attempt to rigorously define calculus in the language of infinitesimals and infinitely large numbers, rather than the idea of a limit. Now called nonstandard analysis, the number systems created (namely, the hyperreals and hypernaturals) have properties which are suited to solving more discrete problems. Ramsey theory deals with complexity in arbitrarily large structures, and the hypernaturals offer different reformulations of existing proofs that often are more insightful than the original.
